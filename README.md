# Gravigo

Gravigo is a Go program for simulating the orbit of N objects under their mutual gravitation. It is a porting of my two continuous previous projects written in C++. Visit this repository for more details. Gravigo is meant to be the exact replica but with native support for orbit plotting without relying on Python's Matplotlib. It also supports concurrent simulation using goroutines to allow faster processing.
