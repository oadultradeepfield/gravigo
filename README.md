# Gravigo

Gravigo is a Go program for simulating the orbit of N objects under their mutual gravitation. It is a porting of my two continuous previous projects written in C++. Visit [this repository](https://github.com/oadultradeepfield/n-body-orbit-simulation) for more details. Gravigo is meant to be the exact replica but with native support for orbit plotting without relying on Python's Matplotlib. It also supports concurrent simulation using goroutines to allow faster processing.

## Development Roadmap

- [x] Port the previous C++ implementation to Go with additional project structure improvement.
- [ ] Migrate the Python matplotlib visualization to [Gonum Plot](https://github.com/gonum/plot) for native experiences.
- [ ] Add concurrency support with goroutines in Runge-Kutta numerical integration for faster processing.
